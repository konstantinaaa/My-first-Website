            A coral reef is an underwater ecosystem characterized by
            reef-building corals. Reefs are formed of colonies of coral polyps
            held together by calcium carbonate. Most coral reefs are built from
            stony corals, whose polyps cluster in groups.

            The Grand Canyon[a] is a steep-sided canyon carved by the Colorado
            River in Arizona, United States. The Grand Canyon is 277 miles (446
            km) long, up to 18 miles (29 km) wide and attains a depth of over a

            An aurora also commonly known as the northern lights is a natural
            light display in Earth's sky, predominantly seen in high-latitude
            regions (around the Arctic and Antarctic). Auroras display dynamic
            patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals,
            or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky.

            The Himalayas, or Himalaya is a mountain range in Asia, separating
            the plains of the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan Plateau. The
            range has some of the Earth's highest peaks, including the highest,
            Mount Everest. More than 100 peaks exceeding elevations of 7,200 m
            (23,600 ft) above sea level lie in the Himalayas.
